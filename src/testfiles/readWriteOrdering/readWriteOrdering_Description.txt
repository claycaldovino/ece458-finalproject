TITLE:

	Read Write Ordering

DESCRIPTION: 

	We are testing that read-write follow right order. We are doing read to a row, bank and column, and 
	we have subsequent write and read to the same locations. In this case, although read to read have smaller
	delay than read to write, we cannot read issue read-read before we issue write. 

INPUT: 

	0x001540a0 	 READ 	 10
	0x001540a0 	 WRITE 	 20
	0x001540a0 	 READ 	 30

	In this case, all the requests are for bank-5, row-10, and column-20. 
	

Expected Output (same bank/col):
	Although the third request (READ) would take less time than the second command (WRITE), expect that the
	second command gets serviced first.
	This is what we expect to get timining wise:

	first READ at time 12 because it is the begining of the next DRAM cycle.
	Then wait tRP --56 CPU cycles -- to issue ACT (12+56 =68 )
	Then issue RD command after tRCD --56 that is time = 68+56=124
	Then issue WR after delay of tRTW=tCAS+tCCD+2-tCWL --> (14+4+2-10)*4 + 124 = 164
	Then issue RD after delay of tWTR = 8*4 = 32. that is at time = 164+32 = 19
	
12	PRE	5
68	ACT	5	10
124	RD	5	20
164	WR	5	20
196	RD	5	20
