1) Out of Sequence test


0x2000D5C0	IFETCH		0
0x1FF96FC0	WRITE		2
0x2000D600	IFETCH		1
0x2000D5C0	IFETCH		3

In this test, the time issued for third request is in the past compared
to the second request. So, this is an ERROR! The expected result is
that the program should exit immediately displaying
"ERROR! CPU requests are not sequentially ordered"


2) Two requests at the same time:

0x2000D5C0	IFETCH		0
0x1FF96FC0	WRITE		1
0x2000D600	IFETCH		1
0x2000D5C0	IFETCH		3

In this test, the time issued for the second request and the third requests are
equal. This cannot happen because CPU cannot issue two commands at the same time.
Hence the program should exit immediately displaying 
"Error!!! CPU  cannot issue more than 1 request at the same time"
