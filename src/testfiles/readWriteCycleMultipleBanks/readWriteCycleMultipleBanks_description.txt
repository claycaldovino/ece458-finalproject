TITLE:
	Testing read/write cycles on multiple banks banks.

DESCRIPTION: 
	This test is to make sure that we are interleaving commands throughout multiple banks and that timing constraints are obeyed. 

TRP - precharge to activate, 14 CPU - 56 cycles
tRCD - active to read, 14 DRAM, 56 CPU cycles
CL - read to data, 14 DRAM, 56 CPU cycles
tRC - activate to precharge, 50 DRAM, 200 CPU
tRTP - Read to Precharge delay, 32 DRAM, 8 CPU
tRRD - Activate to activate to different banks, 24 DRAM, 6 CPU
tCCD - Time between writes/reads, 16 DRAM, 4 CPU cycles


Addresses used only differ in banks (same row/col)
Bank A = 0x1FF83000
Bank B = 0x1FF9F000
Bank C = 0x1FF8B000

INPUT: 

0x1FF83000	READ 0
0x1FF83000	WRITE 1
0x1FF9F000  READ 2
0x1FF9F000  WRITE 3
0x1FF8B000	READ 4
0x1FF8B000	WRITE 5


We expect to see the PRE, ACT, READ, then WRITE commands grouped together and interleaved throughout the 3 banks in A, B, C order.

There should be a 1 CPU/4 DRAM cycle difference between the Precharges in different banks
56 DRAM cycles (tRCD) between 

Expected Output (same bank/col):


0x1FF83000 PRE 4 (1 CK between precharges)
0x1FF9F000 PRE 8
0x1FF8B000 PRE 12

0x1FF83000 ACT 56 (tRP = 56)
0x1FF9F000 ACT 80 (tRRD = 24)
0x1FF8B000 ACT 104 (tRRD = 24)

0x1FF83000 READ 112 (tRCD = 56)
0x1FF9F000 READ 136 (tRCD = 24)
0x1FF8B000 ACT 104 (tRRD = 24)
