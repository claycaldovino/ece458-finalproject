TITLE:
	Write Cycle timing basic test

DESCRIPTION: 
	We are testing that the write cycle  (write to write in same bank different rows) obeys timing constraints. It is a very basic test that sends two read commands to the same bank, but different rows. Testing tRP, tRCD, CL, tRC, tRTP as shown below.

TRP - precharge to activate, 14 CPU - 56 cycles
tRCD - active to read, 14 DRAM, 56 CPU cycles
CL - read to data, 14 DRAM, 56 CPU cycles
tRC - activate to precharge, 50 DRAM, 200 cycles
tRTP - Read to Precharge delay, 32 DRAM, 8 cycles
tCCD - Time between writes/reads, 16 DRAM, 4 CPU cycles


INPUT: 

0x1FF9B000  WRITE 0
0x1FFBB000  WRITE 1


We expect to see a precharge, active and then write for the first command, followed by the same sequence for the second.

Expected Output (same bank/col):

Row 4092:
0x1FF9B000 PRE 0 (tRP = 56)
0x1FF9B000 ACT 56 (tRCD = 56)
0x1FF9B000 WRITE 112 (tCCD + CL = 120)

Row 4093:
0x1FFBB000 PRE 232 (tRP = 56)
0x1FFBB000 ACT 288 (tRCD = 56)
0x1FFBB000 READ 344 (tCCD + CL = 120)

0	PRE	6
56	ACT	6	4092
112	WR	6	1536
232	PRE	6
288	ACT	6	4093
344	WR	6	1536
