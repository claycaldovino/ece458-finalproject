Priority Check Test

We use a priority system to determine the best command to issue that is legal. We use the following priorities:

WAIT: -1
PRECHARGE: 0, 3
ACTIVATE: 2
READ: 4
WRITE: 4
STARVING: 10

Prechagre has two priorities: 0 for when it shares the queue with requests to a currently open row and 3 for when it does not and can safely issue the command. Starving is given a 10 to ensure it is satisfied first. Commands with the same priority are compared with their issued time to issue the oldest command.

Input:

0x00024008 	 READ 	 0 
0x00024010 	 READ 	 1 
0x00044008 	 READ 	 2 
0x00024028 	 WRITE 	 3

We should see a B1R1 activate to begin satisfying commands and then finish with 2 reads and a write before changing rows to satisfy the read issued at CPU tick 2.

Output:

0	PRE	1
56	ACT	1	1
112	RD	1	1
128	RD	1	2
168	WR	1	5
288	PRE	1	
344	ACT	1	2
400	RD	1	1
