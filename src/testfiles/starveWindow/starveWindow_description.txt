Starvation Window

To improve performance we allow other commands to be issued while a 
request is starving, so long as it does not interefere with the starving
commands compeletion. There is a window before the starving command 
where no conflicting command can be issued.

Input:
0x00024008 	 WRITE 	 0
0x00024008 	 READ 	 1
0x00024008 	 WRITE 	 2
0x00024008 	 READ 	 3
0x00024008 	 WRITE 	 4
0x00024008 	 READ 	 5
0x00024008 	 WRITE 	 6
0x00028008 	 READ 	 200

The first 6 commands should keep the controller busy long enough to
cause the last requests to starve, increasing their priority, delaying
the final read request. First the ACT is delayed by one DRAM cycle to
allow the starving WR issued at CPU tick 4 to complete, then the RD is
delayed 5 DRAM cycles to allow the last starving WR to complete.

Output:
0	PRE		1
56	ACT		1	1
112	WR		1	1
144	RD		1	1
184	WR		1	1
200 PRE		2	
216	RD		1	1
256	WR		1	1
260 ACT		2	1
288	RD		1	1
328 WR		1	1
332 RD		2	1
