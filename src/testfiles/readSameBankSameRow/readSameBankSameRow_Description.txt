TITLE:
	Multiple reads to the same bank and same row test

DESCRIPTION: 
	It is a very basic test that sends two read commands to the same bank, and same rows.Since we are following open 
	page policy, the bank and row should remain open until the next access to the same row. So, if the next access is 
	to the same bank and same row, we only have to issue READ after tCL+tBURST time delay.

TRP - precharge to activate, 14 CPU - 56 cycles
tRCD - active to read, 14 DRAM, 56 CPU cycles
CL - read to data, 14 DRAM, 56 CPU cycles
CL - read to data, 14 DRAM, 56 CPU cycles
tBURST - time for data burst, 16 CPU cycles

INPUT: 

0x00c8c0a0 	 READ 	 50
0x00c8c0c8 	 READ 	 60

	In this test case, the first request is read for  row-10, bank-3 and column-10.
	And the second request is read for roq-10, bank-3 and column-15. 

Expected Output:

	We expect to see a PRE, ACT and then RD for the first command, followed by another RD 
	Since the request is issued in time CPU-time 50,
	The first precharge should be issued at time the next DRAM cycle which is 52.
	Then wait for PRE to ACT delay--> tRP=52. So, ACT command at time 52+56 = 108
	Then ACT to READ delay--> tRCD = 56. So RD at time 108+56 = 164
	Then it takes addtional tBurst =16 CPU cycle to complete the request. --> 164+16 =180

	Now, next RD command can be issued at time t= 180. This way, the data from the first read
	does not conflict with the data from the second read.
