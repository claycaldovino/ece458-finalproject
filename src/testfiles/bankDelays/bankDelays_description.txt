Bank Delays

There are bank to bank timing constraints that must be satisfied.
They are:
	RD->RD		tBURST
	RD->WR		tCAS - tCWL + tBURST
	WR->WR		tBURST
	ACT->ACT	tRRD
	
Input:
0x00024008 	 READ 	 0 
0x00028008 	 READ 	 1 
0x0002c008 	 WRITE 	 2 

This should create scenarios where the bank to bank delays are preventing
execution. The activates are pushed back, the read to bank to is delayed
by the reads to bank 1, and the final write to bank 3 is delayed by the
read to bank 2.

Output:
0	PRE		1
4	PRE		2
8	PRE		3
56	ACT		1	1
80	ACT		2	1
104	ACT		3	1
112	RD		1	1	
128	RD		1	1
144	RD		2	1
176	WR		3	1
