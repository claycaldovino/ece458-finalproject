TITLE:
	Requests Out of Sequence Test

DESCRIPTION:
	This test is designed to test if CPU requests are not issued chronologically.

INPUT:

	0x2000D5C0	IFETCH		0
	0x1FF96FC0	WRITE		2
	0x2000D600	IFETCH		1
	0x2000D5C0	IFETCH		3

	Requests 2 is issued before request 3. So, they are not chronological. Based on this input,
	the program should echo an error.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
	ERROR! CPU requests are not ordered chronologically
