Starving Request Test

Our program should find and give priority to any starving command.

Input:
0x00024008 	 READ 	 0
0x00024008 	 READ 	 1
0x00024008 	 READ 	 2
0x00024008 	 READ 	 3
0x00024008 	 READ 	 4
0x00044008 	 READ 	 5
0x00024008 	 READ 	 6
0x00024008 	 READ 	 7
0x00024008 	 READ 	 8
0x00024008 	 READ 	 9
0x00024008 	 READ 	 10
0x00024008 	 READ 	 11
0x00024008 	 READ 	 12
0x00024008 	 READ 	 13
0x00024008 	 READ 	 14
0x00024008 	 READ 	 15


The first 5 commands are a Read to the same bank/row/col and should prevent the Read issued at time 5 from completing because it is to a different row in the same bank. Eventually it will starve then take priority and complete before returning to the others.
