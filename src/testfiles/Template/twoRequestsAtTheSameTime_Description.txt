TITLE:
	Two requests at the same time

DESCRIPTION:
	This test is designed to test if multiple requests are issued at the same time.
	Ideally, a CPU cannot issue multiple requests at the same time. If it does, it is
	classified as a random error.

INPUT:

	0x2000D5C0	IFETCH		0
	0x1FF96FC0	WRITE		1
	0x2000D600	IFETCH		1
	0x2000D5C0	IFETCH		3

	Requests 2 and 3 have same CPU issue time. Based on this input file, the program should
	crash, and report the error.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
	Error!!! CPU  cannot issue more than 1 request at the same time
